#Python lab 1
#Learn from the online interactive tutorial and finish the below tasks
#You can edit in this file by filling blanks after each question.
#Submit the .py file for your own reference
#This practice is not graded, but will help you to get started on Python for
#the homework

#####
#1. function in python
####

#def printHello(): #remove the # sign at the beginning of this line. def is function definition
    #tab is IMPORTANT in python. tab in python replaces {} in C++
    #print string hello world

#outside of the function, just call the name of the function will run it
#printHello()
#Go to Run -> Run module in this editor to run this program.

#####
#2. variable definition in python
#####

#def someVars():
    #define a few integer and float numbers, add them together and print result out

#call the function to run it

#####
#3. define a list in python
#####

#def mylis():
    #define a list with 5 numbers, print it out

    #define an empty list and append a few numbers into it, then print it out

#call your mylis func to execute

#####
#4. string output
#####

#def printstr(input_str1, input_int1):
    #convert int into string and add the int with the string to form a long string
    #(google what func to use)
    #print the long str out

#call your func and give it a string and an int as input when you call it

####
#5. passing var to func and return
####

#def funcvars(inputvar1, inputvar2):
    #add the input numbers together
    #returen the result

#use a result variable to receive the result from funcvars and print the result out

####
#6. for loop
####

#def go_over_list(mylis):
    #use for loop to go over the input list and print out items one by one

#def go_over_list1():
    #use for loop to directly print out numbers from 10 to 17

#def go_over_list2(mylis):
    #use for loop & go over your list
    #multiply 2 to every item in your list, print results out

#def go_over_list3(mylis):
    #create an empty list resLis
    #go over items in the input list, multiply 2 to every item
    #add result one by one to resLis
    #return resLis

####
#7. while loop
####

#do all the problems in 6 using while loop instead

#Python is an easier PL to learn than C++ and looks like C++
#From this lab experience, reflect and summary what it feels like
#when you are learning a new PL that is similar to a PL that you already know?
